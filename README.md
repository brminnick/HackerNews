# HackerNews

A Xamarin.Forms app for displaying the top posts on Hacker News.

This app uses the AWS's [Text Analytics Service](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/resources/) to analyze the sentiment of each headline. If a headline is happy, 😃 will appear. If a headline is sad, ☹️ will appear. If a headline is neither happy nor sad, 😐 will appear.
